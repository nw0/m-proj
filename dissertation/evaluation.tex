\wip{Benefits to Rust}

Buffer overflows and microbenchmarks shown.
Look at optimised MIPS code and performance---not much to be gained?
But: no unwind?
Sealed capabilities, FFI and capabilities---maybe some FFI code can be
made safe!

\wip{Benefits to CHERI}

Better defined semantics? Less room for miscompilation?
Lifetimes and borrowing mean less guessing about capabilities.
If Rust is already fast, will CHERI make it even faster -> natural
choice? Since CHERI adds smaller overheads than e.g.~C.
