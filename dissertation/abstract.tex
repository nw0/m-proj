The lack of memory safety in C still causes untold numbers of security
vulnerabilities up to the present day.
Both Rust, a safe programming language, and CHERI, an architecture
providing hardware capabilities, claim to provide low-overhead memory
safety to prevent exploits.

This work explores the implications and interactions of CHERI
capabilities for a safe language, Rust.
Previous work typically considers capabilities and type-safe languages
as mutually exclusive protection; instead I present evidence that the
two can, in fact, complement each other.
To do this, I implement Rust compilation to a CHERI architecture,
demonstrating that capabilities are effective against previous Rust
vulnerabilities and detailing how they can be used to maximise memory
safety in Rust with minimal overheads.
