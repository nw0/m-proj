\section{Capabilities}
A \emph{capability} is the address of an entity combined with the
permitted actions using that reference~\cite{Dennis:1966:PSM}.
An entity may traditionally be a memory segment, and actions could be to
write or execute that segment.
Throughout this work, a recurring theme will be the arbitrary
dereferencing of pointers, an action permitted in Unsafe Rust, but not
Safe Rust.


\section{CHERI: Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions}
CHERI extends a 64-bit RISC ISA to support capabilities.
Its design emphasises incremental adoption, and the principles of least
privilege and intentional use, to mitigate unintended vulnerabilities.
Its hybrid approach enables capability code to be used alongside
non-capability code, allowing a concentration on higher-risk code and
libraries~\cite{cheri-v6}.
