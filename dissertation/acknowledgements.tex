I thank the following people for their help with this work:

\qquad My supervisors, Simon W.\ Moore and Khilan Gudka, for guidance which was
essential in focussing the project, and especially for my early
familiarisation with CHERI and its LLVM fork;

\qquad Alex Richardson, for repeated help with the LLVM compiler and debugging
when Rust broke its assumptions, as well as the CheriBSD emulator;

\qquad David Chisnall, Andrew Paverd, and colleagues at Microsoft Research, for
fruitful discussions on the application of capabilities, sealing, and
expounding the utility of mixing capability and non-capability pointers;

\qquad and finally the Rust community and Ralf Jung, for fueling my engagement
with, and understanding of, Rust semantics.
